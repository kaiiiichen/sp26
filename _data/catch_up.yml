### CATCH-UP ORDERING ###
# Mirrors the structure/behavior of `_data/discussions.yml`.
#
# each entry requires either a 'slug' or a 'title' field
#
# use the slug if you utilize the _catch_up collection. this will take info
# from the front matter of the corresponding file in _catch_up/
#
# nonumber suppresses the label and numbering for the entry
# skip: true will omit the catch-up from the schedule entirely
#
# link overrides the default link to the collection page if you provided a slug
# or provides an external link
catch_up:
  - skip: true # no catch-up on the first Friday
  - slug: "01" # pandas
  - title: "Data Cleaning, EDA, Regex"
  - title: "Visualizations"
  - title: "Sampling, Modeling, SLR"
  - title: "Constant Model, Loss, Transformations"
